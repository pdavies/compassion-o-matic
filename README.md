# Compassion-O-Matic

Compassion-O-Matic is a Chrome extension to see how much of a difference is made by news outlets' choice between the words "refugee" and "migrant". It was written during the 2015 crisis in Europe, during which time the BBC and others adopted an editorial policy of using the term "migrant" despite "refugee" being a more relevant description in most cases. For arguments on either side of this debate, see for example [the Financial Times][1] and [al Jazeera][2].
