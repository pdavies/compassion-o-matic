# Compassion-O-Matic
Compassion-O-Matic is a Chrome extension to show the effects of choosing "refugee" over "migrant" in coverage of the 2015 refugee crisis in Europe. It performs some simple regex replacements on text nodes, to correct news outlets with a habit of dehumanising those "migrant swarms". Migrants smuggled onto the page via Ajax will slip through the net.

This project was built as a gimmick to make a point, but turned out to have a surprising impact on me, even though I thought I was already in the "compassionate" camp. The words we choose truly matter. They burrow into our perceptions, whether we notice or not.
